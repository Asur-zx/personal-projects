-88 keys : 52 white and 36 black
-lowest A0 27.5 hz to highest c8 4186hz
-each sound contains fundamental frequency(pitch) and harmonics(overtunes) to contribute to rich tones
-to imitate the sound, there is to be clear sound to hammer striking and a sustained tone
-have to create mixture of different frequencies
-combination of sine waves and additional frequencies at integer multiple of higher frequncies
-eg: for middle c or c4 at 261.63hz, create a wave of 261.63 hz and harmonics of 523.25 hz and 748.88hz
-other possibilities are sinewave square, sawtooth and sound may be attack, sustain and decay
